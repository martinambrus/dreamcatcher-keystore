This is a helper repository for the [DreamCatcher](https://github.com/martinambrus/DreamCatcher/) project. It doesn't do anything at all on its own.

This particular repository contains interfaces used thorough the project in its various microservices, so the code in there does not repeat over and over.

It also helps to keep the code in all of the microservices using this repository up to date with latest changes and fixes.
